# ploidyfit
Matlab code that fits a piecewise linear model to nuclear cross-sectional area data (in pixels). The piecewise linear model consists of 4 horizontal line pieces representing ploidy levels 2C, 4C, 8C and 16C.

whole_dataset_model.m is a runnable script that calls helper functions linfit.m and piecewiseLine.m. More info is given inside the scripts.
